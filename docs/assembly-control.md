# Electronics Wiring and Control Board Setup

## Notes on Handling Electronics
electricity goes zappy

## Setting Up the Control Board
Before getting into initializing the robot setup, we'll begin by connecting power to the [motor control PCB](./Electrical-Assembly.md).

1. Connect the red fork of the 12V power cable (shorter cable with large connector) to the V+ label on the 12V power supply.
2. Connect the black fork for the 12V power cable to the V- label on the 12V power supply.
3. Connect the red fork of the 5V power cable (longer cable with small connector) to the V- label on the 5V power supply.
4. Connect the black fork of the 5V power cable to the V- label on the 5V power supply.
5. Connect red, yellow, and black cables to back of power switch.
