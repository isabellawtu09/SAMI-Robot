# Aaron-Robot
Raspberry Pi code for the modified Aster robot that's itself a modified to be cheaper Poppy robot.

Based on the [Aster](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3992150) robot, which is a modified [Poppy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2280067) robot that uses MG996R servo motors instead of the much more expensive dynamixels. The code basis is being build on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a [SunFounder Robot Hat v2.0](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/robot-hat/en/latest/), with the associated code for use [here](https://github.com/sunfounder/robot-hat), with much of the low level concepts stolen from [Poppy's open source code](https://github.com/poppy-project).

Using a configuration file currently just shamelessly stolen from poppy-humanoid.

RobotHAT does have TTS connection included out of the box, which is cool.


## Motor Control
There are 21 motors total.

Each arm has 5 motors:
 - Shoulder pitch
 - Shoulder roll
 - Arm twist
 - Elbow roll
 - Single tendon gripper

Each leg has 3 motors:
 - Hip
 - Knee
 - Ankle

The torso and head have 5 motors:
 - Head nod
 - Head turn
 - Head tilt
 - Torso tilt
 - Torso bow

Each servo has its own PTC fuse to prevent melting itself due to stall state (a self resetting fuse)

Each servo group (i.e. right arm, left leg) is on its own relay, controlled via transistor from the Arduino.

Alternatively, throw out the gripper and head tilt, and maybe all the torso motion, which pulls it down to 16 servos.

With 21 we definitely need 2 sets of servo controllers to squish together. Or put all the limbs on one board, and the head and torso off the arduino pwm pins directly. IDK, still working on that.

## Face
We have two 8x8 neopixel neomatrices for the eyes.


## Wiring
Some of the wiring is in the table. Need to build the full wiring diagram.

| Arduino | Servo Shield | Left Eyes | Right Eye |
| :------ | :----------: | --------: | --------: |
| GND     |   GND        | GND       | GND       |
| 5V      |   5V         | ------    | ------    |
| A4      |   SDA        | ------    | ------    |
| A5      |   SCL        | ------    | ------    |
| Pin 6   | ------       | Din       | ------    |
| Pin 7   | ------       | ------    | Din       |
