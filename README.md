# Aaron-Robot
Raspberry Pi code for the modified Aster robot that's itself a modified to be cheaper Poppy robot.

Based on the [Aster](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3992150) robot, which is a modified [Poppy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2280067) robot that uses MG996R servo motors instead of the much more expensive dynamixels. The code basis is being build on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a [SunFounder Robot Hat v2.0](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/robot-hat/en/latest/), with the associated code for use [here](https://github.com/sunfounder/robot-hat), with much of the low level concepts stolen from [Poppy's open source code](https://github.com/poppy-project).

Using a configuration file currently just shamelessly stolen from poppy-humanoid.

RobotHAT does have TTS connection included out of the box, which is cool.
