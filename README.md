# Jamie Robot
All of the pieces for the modified Aster robot that is, itself, a modified-to-be-cheaper Poppy robot.

Based on the [Aster](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3992150) robot, which is a modified [Poppy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2280067) robot that uses MG996R servo motors instead of the much more expensive dynamixels, and then modified more to instead use the HiWonder HTS serial bus servo motor series.

## High Level System Capabilities

### Robot
Serial USB connection to PC to send expressions/joint movement commands
Capabilities & DoF:
 1. 8x8 LED matrix eyes, with a bunch of premade expressions (but, as previously mentioned, you can send custom ones, or swap out the eyes entirely
 2. 3 DoF in neck for pan, forward tilt, and side tilt
 3. 2 DoF in chest for forward-backward and side-side lean
 4. 4 DoF for arm (two for the shoulder, one in bicep for arm rotation, one in elbow)
 5. Single tendon gripper for open/close hand (or easy swap in for static or other hand)
 6. 3 DoF for legs (one each hip, knee, ankle)
 7. Mr. Potato Head style swappable headshell parts

### Sensor Box
Serial USB connection sends messages to PC about:
 - Button presses
 - Person presence/movement (ultrasonic + PIR, weâ€™re still fiddling with calibration, but basically to register is someone walks by or comes up to the system)
 - RFID (for specific participant recognition)

### Captions/Speakers/Video/Microphone
Captions are a mini monitor hooked up to the computer, speakers, video and microphone are a webcam or whatever hardware connected to a PC.

### Utilities/etc:
 - JSON-structured animation/behavior/interaction authoring
 - Planning to make some C libraries (with python and c# wrappers) for things like handling serial communication and running the JSON animations/etc
 - Premade eye expressions
 - Premade robot animations/behaviors

## Assembly

## Operation
High level command and operation is managed on a computer system, 
Low level communication with the robot is performed via serial over USB, using the communication packet architecture presented below. 

### Serial Communication Packet Architecture
Each serial packet sent or recieved includes static starting and ending bytes to denote when a packet is complete, and the content between these bytes is our message.
 - Packet start byte char: <
 - Packet end byte char: >

Each message begins with a message topic, which is a single char byte defining the type and structure of content the rest of the message will include. A list of all existing message topics is below:
 - J - [Joint Message]()
 - E - [Emote Message]()
 - B - [Button Message]()
 - P - [Person Detected Message]()

These existing message types, corresponding message topics, and remaining content structure are each presented individually below.

#### Joint Message


#### Emote Message


#### Button Message


#### Person Detected Message
