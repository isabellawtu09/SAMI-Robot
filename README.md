# Aaron-Robot
All of the pieces for the modified Aster robot that's itself a modified to be cheaper Poppy robot.

Based on the [Aster](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3992150) robot, which is a modified [Poppy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2280067) robot that uses MG996R servo motors instead of the much more expensive dynamixels. Some of the low level concepts stolen from [Poppy's open source code](https://github.com/poppy-project).

Using a configuration file currently just shamelessly stolen from poppy-humanoid.

***Everything in this README is out of date***

## Motor Control
There are 21 motors total.

Each arm has 5 motors:
 - Shoulder pitch
 - Shoulder roll
 - Arm twist
 - Elbow roll
 - Single tendon gripper

Each leg has 3 motors:
 - Hip
 - Knee
 - Ankle

The torso and head have 5 motors:
 - Head nod
 - Head turn
 - Head tilt
 - Torso tilt
 - Torso bow

Each servo has its own PTC fuse to prevent melting itself due to stall state (a self resetting fuse)

Each servo group (i.e. right arm, left leg) is on its own relay, controlled via transistor from the Arduino.

With 21 we definitely need 2 sets of servo controllers to squish together. Or put all the limbs on one board, and the head and torso off the arduino pwm pins directly. IDK, still working on that.

## Face
We have two 8x8 neopixel neomatrices for the eyes.
