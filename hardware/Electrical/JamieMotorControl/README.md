# Motor control driver board
Driver board for the servo bus motors. Includes connection for LED eyes, serial control for bus servo motors, and power control for bus servo motors, with mounting spot for microcontroller dev board.


## TODO
1. I removed the PTC fuses because they were.... not really all that great when we have a chain? The individual surges would be huge and they aren't really serving a temp protection purpose.
2. Pick microcontroller
3. Add microcrontroller solder in footprint with additional header connectors? idk how best to mount that for easy use/access to all the other pins
4. The actual board layout from the schematic oops
