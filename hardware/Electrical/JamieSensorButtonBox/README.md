# Sensor Box Circuit
This is the circuitry for the sensor box that sits in front of the system. It is not quite complete, as it will include some external wired components. The control circuit might end up being a custom PCB hat for an Arduino Uno... We'll see.

## To-Do:
 - Complete and confirm full assembly wiring and correct operation
 - Build out BoM
 - Maybe adapt to PCB

## Bill of Materials (BoM)
TODO
