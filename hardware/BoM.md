# Bill of Materials (BoM)
The BoM includes all parts for building the full robot and sensor box. This is list is broken down into parts necessary for the [robot](#robot) and parts necessary for the [sensor box](#sensor-box). Within these groups, parts are separated into 3D printed items, and purchased items. Where useful, purchase lists have been provided for use with specific vendors (such as DigiKey) to simplify acquisition.
